   <content type="html">&lt;!-- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown): --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- &gt; Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your project’s page or blog right here from GitHub. --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- It's an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Lanyon. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started playing with interesting data sets on Kaggle. There’s one called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/womens-shoes-prices&quot;&gt;Women’s Shoe Prices&lt;/a&gt; – A list of 10,000 women’s shoes and the prices at which they are sold. I was intrigued by earlier analyses which showed shoes could be sold for more than 3000 USD. Then I dug into the data and found out lots of the pricey stuff were actually wedding bands or jeweleries. Also, there were other inexpensive but non-shoe stuff such as t-shirt and bra. The data provider later promptly updated the raw shoe data after my analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
