title: Diamonds found in the shoe box -- Being skeptical as a Data Scientist

<!-- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown): -->

  <!-- > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub. -->

<!-- It's an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Lanyon. -->

I started playing with interesting data sets on Kaggle. There's one called [Women's Shoe Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/womens-shoes-prices) -- A list of 10,000 women's shoes and the prices at which they are sold. I was intrigued by earlier analyses which showed shoes could be sold for more than 3000 USD. Then I dug into the data and found out lots of the pricey stuff were actually wedding bands or jeweleries. Also, there were other inexpensive but non-shoe stuff such as t-shirt and bra. The data provider later promptly updated the raw shoe data after my analysis.
